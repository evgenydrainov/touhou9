	This is an integer prescale filter that should be combined
	with a bilinear hardware filtering (GL_BILINEAR filter or some such) to achieve
	a smooth scaling result with minimum blur. This is good for pixelgraphics
	that are scaled by non-integer factors.

	The prescale factor and texel coordinates are precalculated
	in the vertex shader for speed.
